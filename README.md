# Network-Traffic-Prediction

This repository is part of a survey paper concerned with mobile Network Traffic Prediction. In such a work, many different approaches applied
to prediction models are explained from a mathematical point of view, and simulations with a real World scenario data set are performed with six 
different approaches: RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN, SARIMA, and decomposed SARIMA. We provide a small version of the data set and the codes developed, 
so other researchers can compare their approaches with the ones we provided or even use them as a foundation for more advanced solutions.
